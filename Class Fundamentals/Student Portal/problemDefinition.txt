Problem Definition : Student Portal with Inner Classes, Object Class Methods, and Memory Concepts 

Create a Student Portal System that stores student details and their enrolled 
courses. Implement a main Student class and define an inner class Course. Use 
method-local inner classes to represent semester-wise enrollments, and 
anonymous inner classes for scholarship eligibility logic. Override the equals(), 
toString(), and hashCode() methods from the Object class to compare student 
objects. Demonstrate how objects are created in the heap, how method calls go 
on the stack, and when objects become eligible for garbage collection.
