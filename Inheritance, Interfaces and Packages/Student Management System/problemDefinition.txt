Design a Java-based Student Management System by creating and organizing 
related classes into different user-defined packages: 
student.details – to store and display student personal and academic information. 
student.utility – to provide utility functions such as grade calculation or input 
validation. 
student.services – to offer services like student registration, listing all students, or 
searching by ID. 
Implement interaction among classes from different packages using import 
statements and proper access modifiers.
