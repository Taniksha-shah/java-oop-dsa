Problem Definition: You are developing a chat application where users may 
use unnecessary spaces, special characters, or slang. Create a program that 
sanitizes each input string in real-time by: 
● Removing extra spaces 
● Replacing inappropriate words with *** 
● Formatting the message (capitalization rules)
