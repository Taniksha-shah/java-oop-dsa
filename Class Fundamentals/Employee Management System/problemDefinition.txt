Problem Definition : Employee Management System using Class Fundamentals and Constructors 

Design a simple Employee Management System to model employees in a 
company. Each employee should have attributes like ID, name, department, and 
salary. Use appropriate access modifiers to ensure encapsulation. Implement 
default and parameterized constructors, and demonstrate constructor overloading. 
Track the number of employees created using a static variable and showcase the 
use of the this keyword and this() constructor chaining. Use instanceof to check 
object types during runtime when dealing with contract vs. permanent employees.
