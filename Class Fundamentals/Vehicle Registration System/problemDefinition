Problem Definition: Vehicle Registration System using Annotations, Reflection, and Final Keyword 

Build a Vehicle Registration System where different types of vehicles (Car, Bike, 
Truck) are registered. Use final variables for immutable fields, such as vehicle 
registration numbers. Declare a final class for utility methods and restrict 
overriding certain methods with final. Implement custom annotations like 
@VehicleInfo to mark important fields and use reflection to extract metadata at 
runtime (e.g., print fields annotated with @VehicleInfo). Demonstrate the use of 
Java meta-annotations in defining your custom annotation.
